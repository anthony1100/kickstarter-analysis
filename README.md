# kickstarter-analysis

# 1.	Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

## a) Purpose:

### 1)	Louise wants better success on her play, Fever, by better knowing how other campaigns fared in their launch dates and funding goals. 

# 2.	Analysis and Challenges

## a)	Analysis 
#### 1) Analysis included a series of analysis supported by a Pivot Chart and Excel Commands such as =countifs, =sums, etc. This led to finding the key parameters and optimum output that maximized "successful" and minimized "failed"

## b)	Challenges 
#### 1) The big challenge was to attempt to do all this sorting and analysis via manual steps. This would have taken an infinte amount of time and likely include many errors because of the tidium from doing all this manually. 

#### b)	Getting the correct output from analysis was the main challenge. This would especially true with several “final results”  provided so we, the “Analyzers”, knew where the successful end point was

# 3.	Results

### 1)	The best month for the Theater is May (111 Successful) to "Failed" (52 Failed) factor of over 2 to 1. June is a close second to May. 

### 2)	If you launch in December, chances of success to failure is about 1.1:1 and is the least favorable of any month. It appears this is recognize as December is also the lowest Theater month of the year.
